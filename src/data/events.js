    txt: "During and after college I had the opportunity to work alongside the powerhouse Beth Blauer to bring photography classes to children in Department of Juvenile Services detention centers. Over the course of 5 years I worked with a number of girls at the Thomas J. Waxter Children's Detention Center, helping them make photographs and curate their own art shows at galleries and museums around Baltimore."

    txt: "My curatorial studies work led me to my first career, museum education. I have worked for nearly every museum in Baltimore, including The Walters Art Museum, The Jewish Museum of Maryland, The Reginald F. Lewis Museum of African American History and Culture, The Maryland Historical Society, and the Baltimore Museum of Industry. Part of my work with museums was educational outreach into public schools for short and long term projects. I had the amazing opportunity to work with children of all ages to bring art and history into the schools (and students into the museums)."

    txt: "While in Baltimore I also served for two years with AmeriCorps, first as a preschool teacher and then as an educator for a nonprofit that helped house homeless Baltimoreans living with HIV/AIDS. These years and my work within both of the communities we served showed me the heart of Baltimore, a city that I will always love."

    txt: "I moved to Wilmington in 2012 with my husband Dan. I was ready to take a new approach to education and was interested in serving the same students for a full school year, so I joined Peace Rose Montessori as a teacher in the primary classroom. Most of what I know about Montessori I learned from the incredible Elise Zalesky, but I also received my certification from the North American Montessori Center in 2016. In addition to teaching I am also now a co-director of Peace Rose."

In 2008 I started a Southern food blog, <em><a href='http://biscuitsandsuch.com'>Biscuits &amp; Such</a></em>, which has lead me down a challenging and rewarding path that has included 4 cookbooks. My most recent book, <em>The Southern Cast Iron Cookbook</em>, came out this May."
